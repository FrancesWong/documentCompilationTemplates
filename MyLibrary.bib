	abstract = {The concept of fetuses being ‘patients’ can serve a benign protective, cautionary purpose, alerting healthcare providers and pregnant women to the implications that medical treatment can have for fetuses. The concept allows women to provide the children they intend to deliver with the care they consider appropriate. A negative effect occurs, however, if healthcare providers decide to treat pregnant women according to providers’ own views of the best interests of fetuses, and compromise patients’ care and self-determination without their informed consent. Some activists advocate rights of fetuses for the purpose of limiting pregnant women’s self-determination. Recognition that fetuses have legitimate interests, rather than rights, is common, and opens a way to balancing various competing interests without compromising patients’ rights to decide on their medical care. Courts of law generally favor this approach, and tend to allow few limits on women’s choice of indicated medical care while pregnant.},

	abstract = {Since its origin, bioethics has attracted the collaboration of few social scientists, and social scientiﬁc methods of gathering empirical data have remained unfamiliar to ethicists. Recently, however, the clouded relations between the empirical and normative perspectives on bioethics appear to be changing. Three reasons explain why there was no easy and consistent input of empirical evidence into bioethics. Firstly, interdisciplinary dialogue runs the risk of communication problems and divergent objectives. Secondly, the social sciences were absent partners since the beginning of bioethics. Thirdly, the meta-ethical distinction between ‘is’ and ‘ought’ created a ‘natural’ border between the disciplines. Now, bioethics tends to accommodate more empirical research. Three hypotheses explain this emergence. Firstly, dissatisfaction with a foundationalist interpretation of applied ethics created a stimulus to incorporate empirical research in bioethics. Secondly, clinical ethicists became engaged in empirical research due to their strong integration in the medical setting. Thirdly, the rise of the evidence-based paradigm had an inﬂuence on the practice of bioethics. However, a problematic relationship cannot simply and easily evolve into a perfect interaction. A new and positive climate for empirical approaches has arisen, but the original difﬁculties have not disappeared.},

Several interviewees mention the influence that the accreditation process in Canadian healthcare organizations has on the adoption and use of such frameworks. Some of the ethics consultants we interviewed also report on their reluctance to use these tools. Limited empirical work has been done previously on the use of ethics decisionmaking frameworks.

The project sought to generate and reach consensus on standards of practice for Empirical Bioethics research. The project involved 16 academics from 5 different European Countries, with a range of disciplinary backgrounds.
Methods: The consensus process used a modified Delphi approach.
Results: Consensus was reached on 15 standards of practice, organised into 6 domains of research practice (Aims, Questions, Integration, Conduct of Empirical Work, Conduct of Normative Work; Training \& Expertise).
Conclusions: Through articulating these standards we outline a position that encourages responses, and through those responses we will be able to identify points of agreement and contestation that will drive the conversation forward. In that vein, we would encourage researchers, funders and journals to engage with what we have proposed, and respond to us, so that our community of practice of empirical bioethics research can develop and evolve further.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the increased prevalence of bioethics research that seeks to use empirical data to answer normative research questions, there is no consensus as to what an appropriate methodology for this would be. This review aims to search the literature, present and critically discuss published Empirical Bioethics methodologies.
Methods: MedLine, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched between 15/02/12 and 16/06/13 to find relevant papers. These were abstract reviewed independently by two reviewers with papers meeting the inclusion criteria subjected to data extraction.
Results: 33 publications (32 papers and one book chapter) were included which contained 32 distinct methodologies. The majority of these methodologies (n = 22) can be classed as either dialogical or consultative, and these represent two extreme ‘poles’ of methodological orientation. Consideration of these results provoked three central questions that are central to the planning of an empirical bioethics study, and revolve around how a normative conclusion can be justified, the analytic process through which that conclusion is reached, and the kind of conclusion that is sought.
Conclusion: When considering which methodology or research methods to adopt in any particular study, researchers need to think carefully about the nature of the claims they wish to generate through their analyses, and how these claims align with the aims of the research. Whilst there are superficial similarities in the ways that identical research methods are made use of, the different meta-ethical and epistemological commitments that undergird the range of methodological approaches adopted rehearse many of the central foundational disagreements that play out within moral philosophy and bioethical analysis more broadly. There is little common ground that transcends these disagreements, and we argue that this is likely to present a challenge for the legitimacy of the bioethical enterprise. We conclude, however, that this heterogeneity ought to be welcomed, but urge those involved in the field to engage meaningfully and explicitly with questions concerning what kinds of moral claim they want to be able to make, about normative justification and the methodological process, and about the coherence of these components within their work.},

	abstract = {Background: Emerging genomic technologies promise more efficient infectious disease control. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly being used in tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, surveillance, and epidemiology. However, while the use of WGS by public health agencies may raise ethical, legal, and socio-political concerns, these challenges are poorly understood.
Method: Between November 2017 and April 2018, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 key stakeholders across the fields of governance and policy, public health, and laboratory sciences representing the major jurisdictions currently using WGS in national TB programs. Thematic analysis of the interviews was conducted using NVivo 11.
Results: Respondents identified several ethical and practical challenges associated with WGS in TB care and surveillance, all related to issues of trust, including: 1) the power of public health; 2) data sharing and profits derived from surveillance efforts; and 3) concerns regarding who has access to, and can benefit from, the technology. Additional challenges included: the potential utility that WGS adds to a public health program, the risks associated with linking necessary epidemiological metadata to the genomic data, and challenges associated with jurisdictional capacity to implement the technology.
Conclusions: Successful implementation of WGS is dependent on fostering relationships of trust between those working with genomics technology and those directly impacted by it, including clinicians. Building trust (a) between the public and the public health agencies and (b) within public health agencies themselves is critical due to the inherent complexity of WGS and its implementation for communicable disease control purposes.},

The international Convention on the Rights of the Child, almost universally ratified, limits parental powers, and duties, by adolescents’ bevolving capacitiesQ for self-determination. Legal systems may recognize bmature minorsQ as enjoying adult rights of medical consent, even when consent to sexual relations does not absolve partners of criminal liability; their consent does not make the adolescents offenders. There is usually no chronological bage of consentQ for medical care, but a condition of consent, meaning capacity for understanding. Like adults, mature minors enjoy confidentiality and the right to treatment according to their wishes rather than their best interests. Minors incapable of self-determination may grant or deny assent to treatment for which guardians provide consent. Emancipated minors’ self-determination may also be recognized, for instance on marriage or default of adults’ guardianship.},

The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the trial judge’s decision to authorize surgery, taking account of principles of family law, criminal law and human rights law. Parental duties to the viable twin were found consistent with the justiﬁcation of allowing, without intending, natural death of the non-viable twin. The right to human dignity of both twins supported the justiﬁcation of separation surgery. The decision did not elevate physicians’ choices over parents’, but subjected both to the law. The hospital was found entitled to bring the case to court, but not obliged; it could have declined surgery in conformity with the parents’ wishes. ᮊ 2001 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Individuals' rights to grant and to deny consent to medical procedures affecting their reproductive health and conﬁdentiality have been progressively advanced. However, access to contraceptive services, while not necessarily opposed, is unjustiﬁably obstructed in some settings. Rights to lawful abortion have been considerably liberalized by legislative and judicial decisions, although resistance remains. Courts are increasingly requiring that lawful services be accommodated under transparent conditions of access and of legal protection. The conﬂict between rights of resort to lawful reproductive health services and to conscientious objection to participation is resolved by legal duties to refer patients to non-objecting providers.},

While there may be a benefit for some boys in high-risk populations and circumstances where the procedure could be considered for disease reduction or treatment, the Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend the routine circumcision of every newborn male.},

	abstract = {An exploration of distributive justice in Canadian infertility treatment requires the integration of ethical, clinical, and economic principles. In 1971, American philosopher John Rawls proposed a theoretical model for fair decision-making in which “rational” and “self-interested” citizens are behind a “veil of ignorance” with respect to both their own position and the position of other decision-makers. Rawls proposed that these self-interested decision-makers, fearing that they are among the least advantaged persons who could be affected by the decision, will agree only upon rules that encode equality of opportunity and that bestow the greatest benefit on the least advantaged citizens. Regarding health policy decision-making, Rawls’ model is best illustrated by Canadian philosopher Warren Bourgeois in his panel of “volunteers.” These rational and self-interested volunteers receive an amnestic drug that renders them unaware of their health, social, and financial position, but they know that they are representative of diverse spheres of citizens whose well-being will be affected by their decision. After describing fair decision-making, Bourgeois considers the lack of a distributive justice imperative in Canada’s Assisted Human Reproduction Act, in contrast to legislation in European nations and Australia, summarizes the economic and clinical considerations that must be provided to the decision-makers behind the “veil of ignorance” for fair decisions to occur, and considers altruism in relation to equality of access. He concludes by noting that among countries with legislation governing assisted reproduction Canada is alone in having legislation that is void of distributive justice in providing access to clinically appropriate infertility care.},

It is of varying degrees of invasiveness, often including clitoridectomy, but all raise health-related concerns, which can be of considerable physical andyor psychological severity, and compromise gynecological and obstetric care. The practice is not based on a requirement of religious observance, although parents usually seek it for their daughters in good faith. It is directed to the social control of women’s sexuality, in association with preservation of virginity and family honor. FGC is becoming increasingly prohibited by law, in countries both of its traditional practice and of immigration. Medical practice prohibits FGC. In compromising women’s health and negating their sexuality, FGC is a human rights abuse that physicians have a role in eliminating by education of patients and communities.},

National sex ratio imbalances where discrimination against women is common have resulted in laws and policies, such as in India and China, to deter and prevent sex selection. Birth ratios of children can be affected by techniques of prenatal sex determination and abortion, preconception sex selection and discarding disfavored embryos, and prefertilization sperm sorting, when disfavored sperm remain unused. Incentives for son preference are reviewed, and laws and policies to prevent sex selection are explained. The elimination of social, economic and other discrimination against women is urged to redress sex selection against girl children. Where there is no general selection against girl children, sex selection can be allowed to assist families that want children of both sexes.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the legal and ethical concept of human subject research in order to determine whether genetic research with already available biosamples and data falls within this concept. Although the ethical concept seems to have evolved to recognize research based on data as human research, from a supranational legal perspective this form of research is not considered human subject research. Thus human subject research regulations do not apply and therefore do not invoke the requirement of obtaining consent prior to using an individual’s biosample or genetic data in research. Furthermore, it remains ambiguous in both the legal and ethical realm whether the use of biosamples or genetic data without additional links to the individual would invoke the same safeguards as research involving additional or specific identifiers. Seeing that research based on already available biosamples and genetic data is not governed by rules concerning human subject research, the second part of the paper analyses whether any consent requirements apply for the further use of already available bio-samples or genetic data in research. Whereas further use of ­biosamples is subject to considerably lax consent requirements under Article 22 of the Oviedo Convention, under the General Data Protection Regulation further use of genetic data might not be subject to a prior consent requirement at all, unless it is stipulated in national laws. When it comes to clinical trials, however, sponsors will have the possibility under Article 28(2) of Regulation 536/2014 to obtain open consent for further use of data in any kind of future research.},

	abstract = {Genetic testing reveals information about a patient’s health status and predictions about the patient’s future wellness, while also potentially disclosing health information relevant to other family members. With the increasing availability and affordability of genetic testing and the integration of genetics into mainstream medicine, the importance of clarifying the scope of conﬁdentiality and the rules regarding disclosure of genetic ﬁndings to genetic relatives is prime. The United Nations International Declaration on Human Genetic Data urges an appreciation for principles of equality, justice, solidarity and responsibility in the context of genetic testing, including a commitment to honoring the privacy and security of the person tested. Considering this global mandate and recent professional statements in the context of a legal amendment to patient privacy policies in Australia, a fresh scrutiny of the legal history of a physician’s duty to warn is warranted. This article inquiries whether there may be anything ethically or socially amiss with a potential future recommendation for health professionals or patients to universally disclose particular cancer predisposition genetic diagnosis to genetic family members. While much of the discussion remains applicable to all genetic diagnosis, the article focuses on the practice of disclosure within the context of BRCA1/2 diagnosis. An ‘ethic of care’ interpretation of legal tradition and current practice will serve to reconcile law and medical policy on the issue of physician disclosure of genetic results to family members without patient consent.},

Yet while unsolicited findings arise in both genomics and radiology, most of the relevant literature to date has tended to focus on only one of these domains. In this article, we synthesize and critically assess similarities and differences between “scanning the body” and “sequencing the genome” from an ethical perspective. After briefly describing the novel diagnostic contexts leading to unsolicited findings, we synthesize and reflect on six core ethical issues that relate to both specialties: terminology; benefits and risks; autonomy; disclosure of unsolicited findings to children; uncertainty; and filters and routine screening. We identify ethical rationales that pertain to both fields and may contribute to more ethically sound policies. Considerations of preserving public trust and ensuring that people perceive healthcare policies as fair also support the need for a combined debate.},

Technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and micro-array based analysis enable genome-wide testing for many heterogeneous abnormalities and predispositions simultaneously. This may challenge the feasibility of providing adequate pre-test information and achieving autonomous decision-making. At a symposium held at the 11th World Congress of Bioethics in June 2012 (Rotterdam), organized by the International Association of Bioethics, these challenges were presented for three different areas in which these so-called ‘new genetics’ technologies are increasingly being applied: newborn screening, prenatal screening strategies and commercial personal genome testing. In this article, we build upon the existing ethical framework for a responsible set-up of testing and screening offers and reinterpret some of its criteria in the light of the new genetics. As we will argue, the scope of a responsible testing or screening offer should align with the purpose(s) of testing and with the principle of respect for autonomy for all stakeholders involved, including (future) children. Informed consent is a prerequisite but requires a new approach. We present preliminary and general directions for an individualized or differentiated set-up of the testing offer and for the informed consent process. With this article we wish to contribute to the formation of new ideas on how to tackle the issues of autonomy and informed consent for (public) healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications of the new genetics.},

Personal genome tests estimate genetic susceptibilities to multiple diseases and other phenotypic traits simultaneously. Providers commonly make use of Terms of Service agreements rather than informed consent procedures. However, to protect consumers from the potential physical, psychological and social harms associated with personal genome testing and to promote autonomous decision-making with regard to the testing offer, we argue that current practices of information provision are insufﬁcient and that there is a place – and a need – for informed consent in personal genome testing, also when it is offered commercially. The increasing quantity, complexity and diversity of most testing offers, however, pose challenges for information provision and informed consent. Both speciﬁc and generic models for informed consent fail to meet its moral aims when applied to personal genome testing. Consumers should be enabled to know the limitations, risks and implications of personal genome testing and should be given control over the genetic information they do or do not wish to obtain. We present the outline of a new model for informed consent which can meet both the norm of providing sufﬁcient information and the norm of providing understandable information. The model can be used for personal genome testing, but will also be applicable to other, future forms of broad genetic testing or screening in commercial and clinical settings.},

Genetics policy makers have maintained that their restriction of predictive testing of children is justified because (a) it shows respect for children’s autonomy and confidentiality, (b) it protects children from harm, and (c) there are no compensating benefits of testing when no effective treatment for the condition is available. Although this approach seems reasonable on its face, a careful examination of the arguments shows that each of the three justifications for restricting testing is flawed. Specifically, I argue that the consensus position is not justified because (a) the appeal to autonomy in this context is baseless and confused, (b) there is no evidence of harm from disclosure, and (c) the claim that there are no benefits from early testing is based on an unjustifiably narrow view of benefits that ignores significant advantages that testing actually provides. Ultimately, for reasons that pediatricians usually consider important, I argue that pediatricians should encourage parents to pursue genetic testing of children at a young age.},

Little is known about how HCPs handle these test requests, given that guidelines recommend such testing is deferred to adulthood unless there is medical benefit to testing before that time. Our study explored the process of decision-making between HCPs and parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 HCPs in 8 regional genetic services across the UK, and data were thematically analysed. We found that instead of saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to such requests, many HCPs framed the consultation as an opportunity to negotiate the optimal time of testing. This, they argued, facilitates parents’ considered decision-making, since parents’ eventual decisions after requesting a test was often to defer testing their child. In cases where parents’ requests remained a sustained wish, most HCPs said they would agree to test, concluding that not testing would not serve the child’s wider best interest. As a strategy for determining the child’s best interest and for facilitating shared decision-making, we recommend that HCPs re-frame requests for testing from parents as a discussion about the optimal time of testing for adult-onset disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Predictive genetic testing is offered to asymptomatic adults even when there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment. Testing of young people in similar circumstances is controversial, and guidelines recommend against it. We sought to document descriptive examples of the occurrence of genetic testing in young people for nonmedical reasons, in the countries where guidelines exist. Methods: Clinical geneticists in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand were surveyed about the occurrence and outcomes of testing in asymptomatic young people for conditions where no prophylaxis or treatment exists and onset is usually in adulthood. Results: Of 301 responses, details were provided of 49 cases where such testing had occurred. The most common condition tested for was Huntington Disease. In 22 cases (45\%), the young person tested was immature, defined as under the age of 14 years. Results were disclosed to only two immature minors and in three cases parents experienced clinically significant anxiety related to how they would pass on information to their gene positive child. In 27 cases (55\%), the young person tested was mature. Results were disclosed to 26 mature minors and it was reported that two individuals experienced an adverse event. Consistent follow-up did not take place and findings represent the minimum frequency of adverse events. The majority of respondents agree with existing guidelines but many believe each case must be considered individually. Conclusion: Clinicians agree with existing guidelines regarding predictive testing in young people, but choose to provide tests for nonmedical reasons in specific cases.

	abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, and patients can present with severe behavioural alterations, including hyperactivity, impulsivity and anxiety, in addition to poor language development and seizures. FXS is a trinucleotide repeat disorder, in which {\textgreater}200 repeats of the CGG motif in FMR1 leads to silencing of the gene and the consequent loss of its product, fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP). FMRP has a central role in gene expression and regulates the translation of potentially hundreds of mRNAs, many of which are involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal synaptic connections. Indeed, disturbances in neuroplasticity is a key finding in FXS animal models, and an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory neuronal circuits is believed to underlie many of the clinical manifestations of this disorder. Our knowledge of the proteins that are regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of multiple targets for therapeutic intervention, some of which have already moved into clinical trials or clinical practice.},

Previous studies of women with a family history of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer suggest that both healthy at-risk women and former cancer patients report increased anxiety upon learning about their increased risks of developing these diseases. Indeed, anxiety about genetic risks has been reported as inﬂuencing decisions about DNA-testing and risk-reducing surgery on healthy breasts and ovaries. This qualitative study of women who had been treated for breast/ovarian cancer investigated their perceptions of, and reactions to, their genetic risks of developing further cancers following genetic testing (BRCA1/2 mutation searching). In-depth interviews were undertaken with 30 women (10 mutation carriers, 8 awaiting a result and 12 who received an inconclusive test result). Whilst the majority of women in all three groups adopted a fatalistic approach with regard to their future health and did not regard their genetic risks as a threat to self, a few reported heightened anxiety on learning they were at increased risk of developing a second primary cancer. The data suggest that affected women understand their genetic risks of cancer within the context of their previous disease experiences. It is observed that women’s responses to their genetic risk are inﬂuenced by the degree to which they have accommodated their risk status in their biography following their diagnosis and treatment of cancer.},

These situations demand integrated incident management responses on the part of the health care facility and community, including resource management, provider liability protection, community education and information, and health care facility decision-making processes designed to allocate resources as justly as possible. If inadequate resources are available despite optimal incident management, a process that is evidence-based and as objective as possible should be used to allocate ventilators. The process and decision tools should be codified pre-event by the local and regional healthcare entities, public health agencies, and the community. A proposed decision tool uses predictive scoring systems, diseasespecific prognostic factors, response to current mechanical ventilation, duration of current and expected therapies, and underlying disease states to guide decisions about which patients will receive mechanical ventilation. Although research in the specifics of the decision tools remains nascent, critical care physicians are urged to work with their health care facilities, public health agencies, and communities to ensure that a just and clinically sound systematic approach to these situations is in place prior to their occurrence.},

	abstract = {Background: Assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 illness, has been a major activity of infection services since the first reports of cases in December 2019.
Objectives: We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK.
Methods: Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
Results: Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to selfisolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials.
Conclusions: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.},

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02\%, suggesting high precision of the datafitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS‐CoV‐2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the fourphase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients’ being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.},

Indeed, from February 2020, Italy is facing an explosion of COVID-19 cases. In particular, the Italian observed case fatality rate (CFR) is much higher than the other countries. Recently, it has been hypothesized that the extensive number of intergenerational contacts – typical of Italian culture – could contribute to explain the high number of deaths observed in Italy. However, through an analysis performed for all the Italian regions, here it is shown that the deaths are localized in specific regions and that the CFRs of different Italian regions are overlapping with the rates of European countries. Moreover, through a correlation analyses between CFRs and different social habits, it is shown that no positive correlation is observed between social behaviours and CFRs. In conclusion, this analyses clearly rejects the possibility that social habits and intergenerational contacts can contribute to explain such a profound effect on the number of deaths observed in Italy during COVID-19 outbreak and more effort should be addressed to evaluate the real amount of positive cases.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated cancelation of elective or non-urgent contact with the healthcare system, including non-urgent nerve conduction studies and electromyography (electrodiagnostic [EDX] studies). The definitions of elective and nonurgent are physician judgments, and often are not straightforward. Clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner, while keeping them, health care personnel and the community safe. Benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process. We have stratified EDX studies into 3 categories: Urgent, Non-urgent and Possibly Urgent, in an effort to help clinicians triage these referrals.

However, each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in managing EDX triaging. Engaging the referring clinician and, at times, the patient, may be useful in the triage process.},

There have been seven pathogenic Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) which cause respiratory infections. Common cold coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 are the four endemic HCoVs. SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are zoonotic emerging epidemic pathogens with significant morbidity, mortality and economic impact. The endemic HCoVs have been known to cause co-infections or can be co-detected with each other or with other respiratory viruses. In general, respiratory viral co-infections are recognized more commonly today with the use of respiratory multiplex molecular diagnostic panels. Clinicians need to be aware of co-infections among HCoVs. A high degree of suspicion in this rapidly evolving outbreak is required in order to make the diagnosis.

As the outbreak of COVID‐19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID‐19 based on the several open datasets on 2019‐nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China. Overall, at the outset of an outbreak like this, it is highly important to readily provide information to begin the evaluation necessary to understand the risks and begin containment activities.},

Or can prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions be done ‘for the sake of the child’? While the last justification, if plausible, would provide a better justification than the other two, it is not clear that even reproductive autonomy justifies prenatal genetic testing for untreatable adult-onset diseases.

	abstract = {Predictive genetic testing is now routinely offered to asymptomatic adults at risk for genetic disease. However, testing of minors at risk for adult-onset conditions, where no treatment or preventive intervention exists, has evoked greater controversy and inspired a debate spanning two decades. This review aims to provide a detailed longitudinal analysis and concludes by examining the debate’s current status and prospects for the future. Fifty-three relevant theoretical papers published between 1990 and December 2010 were identiﬁed, and interpretative content analysis was employed to catalogue discrete arguments within these papers. Novel conclusions were drawn from this review. While the debate’s ﬁrst voices were raised in opposition of testing and their arguments have retained currency over many years, arguments in favour of testing, which appeared sporadically at ﬁrst, have gained momentum more recently. Most arguments on both sides are testable empirical claims, so far untested, rather than abstract ethical or philosophical positions. The dispute, therein, lies not so much in whether minors should be permitted to access predictive genetic testing but whether these empirical claims on the relative beneﬁts or harms of testing should be assessed.},

This ability raises several complex ethical issues. Prospective parents have reproductive rights to obtain information about their fetus. This information may or may not alter pregnancy management. These rights can be in conflict with the rights of the future individual, who will be denied the right to elect or decline testing. This paper highlights the complexity of these issues, details discussions that went into the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) Public Policy Task Force’s development of the Prenatal testing for Adult-Onset Conditions position statement adopted in November 2014, and cites relevant literature on this topic through December 2015. Issues addressed include parental rights and autonomy, rights of the future child, the right not to know, possible adverse effects on childhood and the need for genetic counseling. This paper will serve as a reference to genetic counselors and healthcare professionals when faced with this situation in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Although the causes of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are thought to be primarily environmental, recent studies suggest that a number of genes influence susceptibility. Using targeted case recruitment and online survey instruments, we conducted the largest case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD based on a single collection of individuals to date (3,426 cases and 29,624 controls). We discovered two novel, genome-wide significant associations with PD–rs6812193 near SCARB2 (p{\textasciitilde}7:6{\textbar}10\{\vphantom{\}}10, OR{\textasciitilde}0:84) and rs11868035 near SREBF1/RAI1 (p{\textasciitilde}5:6{\textbar}10\{\vphantom{\}}8, OR{\textasciitilde}0:85)—both replicated in an independent cohort. We also replicated 20 previously discovered genetic associations (including LRRK2, GBA, SNCA, MAPT, GAK, and the HLA region), providing support for our novel study design. Relying on a recently proposed method based on genome-wide sharing estimates between distantly related individuals, we estimated the heritability of PD to be at least 0.27. Finally, using sparse regression techniques, we constructed predictive models that account for 6\%–7\% of the total variance in liability and that suggest the presence of true associations just beyond genome-wide significance, as confirmed through both internal and external cross-validation. These results indicate a substantial, but by no means total, contribution of genetics underlying susceptibility to both early-onset and late-onset PD, suggesting that, despite the novel associations discovered here and elsewhere, the majority of the genetic component for Parkinson’s disease remains to be discovered.},

Currently, it is widely believed that a large fraction of performed studies are never published, but there are no data that directly address this question.
Methods  We have tracked a selection of animal study protocols approved in the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, to assess whether these have led to a publication with a follow-­up period of 7 years.
Results  We found that 60\% of all animal study protocols led to at least one publication (full text or abstract). A total of 5590 animals were used in these studies, of which 26\% was reported in the resulting publications.
Conclusions  The data presented here underline the need for preclinical preregistration, in view of the risk of reporting and publication bias in preclinical research. We plea that all animal study protocols should be prospectively registered on an online, accessible platform to increase transparency and data sharing. To facilitate this, we have developed a platform dedicated to animal study protocol registration: www.preclinicaltrials.eu.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inappropriate testing contributes to soaring healthcare costs within the United States, and teaching hospitals are vulnerable to providing care largely for academic development. Via its “Choosing Wisely” campaign, the American Board of Internal Medicine recommends avoiding repetitive testing for stable inpatients. We designed systems-based interventions to reduce laboratory orders for patients admitted to the wards at an academic facility.
METHODS: We identiﬁed the computer-based order entry system as an appropriate target for sustainable intervention. The admission order set had allowed multiple routine tests to be ordered repetitively each day. Our iterative study included interventions on the automated order set and cost displays at order entry. The primary outcome was number of routine tests controlled for inpatient days compared with the preceding year. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, delays in care, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Data were collected over a 2-month period following interventions in sequential years and compared with the year prior. The ﬁrst intervention led to 0.97 fewer laboratory tests per inpatient day (19.4\%). The second intervention led to sustained reduction, although by less of a margin than order set modiﬁcations alone (15.3\%). When extrapolating the results utilizing fees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there was a cost savings of \$290,000 over 2 years. Qualitative survey data did not suggest an increase in care delays or near-miss events.
CONCLUSIONS: This series of interventions targeting unnecessary testing demonstrated a sustained reduction in the number of routine tests ordered, without adverse effects on clinical care. Published by Elsevier Inc.  The American Journal of Medicine (2017) 130, 1112.e1-1112.e7},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the impact of a higher publishing probability for statistically significant positive outcomes on the false-positive rate in metaanalysis. Design: Meta-analyses of different sizes (N=10, N=20, N=50 and N=100), levels of heterogeneity and levels of publication bias were simulated. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The type I error rate for the test of the mean effect size (ie, the rate at which the meta-analyses showed that the mean effect differed from 0 when it in fact equalled 0) was estimated. Additionally, the power and type I error rate of publication bias detection methods based on the funnel plot were estimated.
Results: In the presence of a publication bias characterised by a higher probability of including statistically significant positive results, the metaanalyses frequently concluded that the mean effect size differed from zero when it actually equalled zero. The magnitude of the effect of publication bias increased with an increasing number of studies and betweenstudy variability. A higher probability of including statistically significant positive outcomes introduced little asymmetry to the funnel plot. A publication bias of a sufficient magnitude to frequently overturn the meta-analytic conclusions was difficult to detect by publication bias tests based on the funnel plot. When statistically significant positive results were four times more likely to be included than other outcomes and a large between-study variability was present, more than 90\% of the meta-analyses of 50 and 100 studies wrongly showed that the mean effect size differed from zero. In the same scenario, publication bias tests based on the funnel plot detected the bias at rates not exceeding 15\%.
Conclusions: This study adds to the evidence that publication bias is a major threat to the validity of medical research and supports the usefulness of efforts to limit publication bias.},

	abstract = {Objective: About half of medical and health-related studies are not published. We conducted a systematic review of reports on reasons given by investigators for not publishing their studies in peer-reviewed journals.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS (until 13/09/2013), and references of identified articles were searched to identify reports of surveys that provided data on reasons given by investigators for not publishing studies. The proportion of non-submission and reasons for non-publication was calculated using the number of unpublished studies as the denominator. Because of heterogeneity across studies, quantitative pooling was not conducted. Exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted.
Results: We included 54 survey reports. Data from 38 included reports were available to estimate proportions of at least one reason given for not publishing studies. The proportion of non-submission among unpublished studies ranged from 55\% to 100\%, with a median of 85\%. The reasons given by investigators for not publishing their studies included: lack of time or low priority (median 33\%), studies being incomplete (median 15\%), study not for publication (median 14\%), manuscript in preparation or under review (median 12\%), unimportant or negative result (median 12\%), poor study quality or design (median 11\%), fear of rejection (median 12\%), rejection by journals (median 6\%), author or co-author problems (median 10\%), and sponsor or funder problems (median 9\%). In general, the frequency of reasons given for non-publication was not associated with the source of unpublished studies, study design, or time when a survey was conducted.
Conclusions: Non-submission of studies for publication remains the main cause of non-publication of studies.

	abstract = {Background Several studies have shown that skin tests are useful tools for the diagnosis of iodinated contrast medium (ICM) allergy, but the real number of false negative results is not known.
Objective To evaluate the negative predictive value of ICM skin tests. Material and Methods One hundred and ﬁfty-nine patients tested in our department because of a previous ICM reaction over the last 9 years were called and asked standardized questions about ICM re-exposure.
Results Twenty-nine patients had been re-exposed to ICM. There were 20 (69.0\%) females and the median age was 55 (34–60) years. The median time interval between the reaction and skin testing was 11.9 (1.6–21.5) years. Twenty-four patients (82\%) had an immediate reaction, four a non-immediate (13.8\%) reaction and no data were available for one patient. Two patients had positive ICM skin tests previously and were re-exposed to a negatively skin-tested ICM and did not react. Only two patients presented a mild reaction during ICM re-injection: one immediate (generalized urticaria lasting for 3 days) and one non-immediate maculopapular reaction. The patient with urticaria was re-tested and re-challenged (negative). The other patient was unable to return for re-testing.
Conclusion Skin testing for ICM hypersensitivity has a negative predictive value of 96.6\% (95\% CI: 89.9–103.2) and none of the reactions in skin-test-negative patients were severe. Multi-centric large surveys are still needed for conﬁrmation.},

	abstract = {The growing competition and ‘‘publish or perish’’ culture in academia might conflict with the objectivity and integrity of research, because it forces scientists to produce ‘‘publishable’’ results at all costs. Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report ‘‘negative’’ results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of ‘‘positive’’ results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and ‘‘productive’’ academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state’s per capita R\&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions’ prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists’ productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high.},

	abstract = {Background: De Winter and Happee [1] examined whether science based on selective publishing of significant results may be effective in accurate estimation of population effects, and whether this is even more effective than a science in which all results are published (i.e., a science without publication bias). Based on their simulation study they concluded that ‘‘selective publishing yields a more accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything, (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective’’ (p.4).
Methods and Findings: Using their scenario with a small to medium population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more effective for the scientific collective than selective publishing of significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority of publishing everything over selective publishing.
Conclusion: Publishing everything is more effective than only reporting significant outcomes.

This review aims to discuss the consequence of the undermined importance of negative results and problems associated with it and will elaborate the importance of reporting negative results. Under-reporting of negative results not only wastes other researchers time, money, and manpower on which their researchers will be based but also introduces bias in meta-analysis leading to distortion of the scientific literature and misleads researchers, doctors, and policymakers in their decision-making. Many such important studies with negative results remain unpublished and therefore unavailable to the scientific community for understanding their values. A large number of human studies with huge risk to life's are carried out with the assurance that the proposed study will be performed with the aim to benefit, and results will be dissipated to everyone concerned, non-publication of such studies with negative results will not only be morally wrong but will also have ethical obligations to deal with.

	abstract = {Objectives: Citation bias concerns the selective citation of scientiﬁc articles based on their results. We brought together all available evidence on citation bias across scientiﬁc disciplines and quantiﬁed its impact. Study Design and Setting: An extensive search strategy was applied to the Web of Science Core Collection and Medline, yielding 52 studies in total. We classiﬁed these studies on scientiﬁc discipline, selection method, and other variables. We also performed random-effects meta-analyses to pool the effect of positive vs. negative results on subsequent citations. Finally, we checked for other determinants of citation as reported in the citation bias literature.
Results: Evidence for the occurrence of citation bias was most prominent in the biomedical sciences and least in the natural sciences. Articles with statistically signiﬁcant results were cited 1.6 (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.3-1.8) times more often than articles with nonsigniﬁcant results. Articles in which the authors explicitly conclude to have found support for their hypothesis were cited 2.7 (CI 2.0-3.7) times as often. Article results and journal impact factor were associated with citation more often than any other reported determinant.
Conclusion: Similar to what we already know on publication bias, also citation bias can lead to an overrepresentation of positive results and unfounded beliefs. Ó 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: Statistically signiﬁcant studies may be cited more than negative studies on the same topic. We aimed to assess here whether such citation bias is present across the medical literature. Study Design and Setting: We conducted a cohort study of the association between statistical signiﬁcance and citations. We selected all therapeutic intervention studies included in meta-analyses published between January and March 2010 in the Cochrane database, and retrieved citation counts of all individual studies using ISI Web of Knowledge. The association between the statistical signiﬁcance of each study and the number of citations it received between 2008 and 2010 was assessed in mixed Poisson models.
Results: We identiﬁed 89 research questions addressed in 458 eligible articles. Signiﬁcant studies were cited twice as often as nonsigniﬁcant studies (multiplicative effect of signiﬁcance: 2.14, 95\% conﬁdence interval: 1.38e3.33). This association was partly because of the higher impact factor of journals where signiﬁcant studies are published (adjusted multiplicative effect of signiﬁcance: 1.14, 95\% conﬁdence interval: 0.87e1.51).
Conclusion: A citation bias favoring signiﬁcant results occurs in medical research. As a consequence, treatments may seem more effective to the readers of medical literature than they really are. Ó 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientiﬁc literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have ‘‘tested’’ a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22\% between 1990 and 2007, with signiﬁcant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, signiﬁcantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with which results are produced and published is decreasing.},

	abstract = {Background Physicians reading the medical literature attempt to determine whether research studies are valid. However, articles with negative results may not provide sufficient information to allow physicians to properly assess validity.
Methods We analyzed all original research articles with negative results published in 1997 in the weekly journals BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine as well as those published in the 1997 and 1998 issues of the bimonthly Annals of Internal Medicine (N = 234). Our primary objective was to quantify the proportion of studies with negative results that comment on power and present confidence intervals. Secondary outcomes were to quantify the proportion of these studies with a specified effect size and a defined primary outcome. Stratified analyses by study design were also performed.
Results Only 30\% of the articles with negative results comment on power. The reporting of power (range: 15\%-52\%) and confidence intervals (range: 55–81\%) varied significantly among journals. Observational studies of etiology/risk factors addressed power less frequently (15\%, 95\% CI, 8–21\%) than did clinical trials (56\%, 95\% CI, 46–67\%, p {\textless} 0.001). While 87\% of articles with power calculations specified an effect size the authors sought to detect, a minority gave a rationale for the effect size. Only half of the studies with negative results clearly defined a primary outcome.
Conclusion Prominent medical journals often provide insufficient information to assess the validity of studies with negative results.},

Where the research has no potential to produce results of direct beneﬁt to the subjects and the subjects are unable to give consent, these requirements are strengthened by an additional condition, that risks should not exceed a certain minimal threshold. In this article, I address the question of whether there should be limits of permissible risks in non-therapeutic research involving competent and healthy subjects. Some commentators argue that competent and informed individuals should have a right to participate even in extremely risky research and that research ethics committees should never reject studies because they are too dangerous. To use David Shaw’s expression, competent volunteers should have ‘a right to participate in high-risk research’. I argue that this idea is ill-founded, as it does not take into account the social mission and complex collaborative nature of research practice as well as the inequity of power between researchers and subjects. Imposition of limits on permissible risks for healthy volunteers is justiﬁed by the need to protect research enterprise and the need to protect the weaker party, namely the subjects. Also, I suggest that the best way to set boundaries on research risks is to leave the judgment of risk acceptability to research ethics committees.},

This has raised concern that important genomic research will be restricted. Different consent procedures have therefore been proposed. This paper explicitly examines the question how, in genomic research, the principles of solidarity and justice can be used to justify forms of diminished individual control over personal data and bio-samples. After a discussion of the notions of solidarity and justice and how they can be related to health care and genomic research, we examine how and in which situations these notions can form a strong moral basis for demanding certain ﬁnancial sacriﬁces. Then we examine when these principles can justify consent procedures which diverge from the ideal standard. Because much genomic research is not expected to lead to immediate (clinical) beneﬁts we also discuss the question of whether we can be obliged to make any sacriﬁces for future (not yet existing) patients. We conclude with the formulation of a number of conditions that have to be met before autonomy sacriﬁces can be reasonably demanded in genomic research.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Evaluate current data sharing activities of UK publicly funded Clinical Trial Units (CTUs) and identify good practices and barriers. Study Design and Setting: Web-based survey of Directors of 45 UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)eregistered CTUs.
Results: Twenty-three (51\%) CTUs responded: Five (22\%) of these had an established data sharing policy and eight (35\%) speciﬁcally requested consent to use patient data beyond the scope of the original trial. Fifteen (65\%) CTUs had received requests for data, and seven (30\%) had made external requests for data in the previous 12 months. CTUs supported the need for increased data sharing activities although concerns were raised about patient identiﬁcation, misuse of data, and ﬁnancial burden. Custodianship of clinical trial data and requirements for a CTU to align its policy to their parent institutes were also raised. No CTUs supported the use of an open access model for data sharing.
Conclusion: There is support within the publicly funded UKCRC-registered CTUs for data sharing, but many perceived barriers remain. CTUs are currently using a variety of approaches and procedures for sharing data. This survey has informed further work, including development of guidance for publicly funded CTUs, to promote good practice and facilitate data sharing. Ó 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the abstracts of various major scholarly databases (Science and Social Science Citation Index (1991–2008), CAB Abstracts and Medline (1970s–2008), the ﬁle drawer problem is gradually getting worse, in spite of an increase in (1) the total number of publications and (2) the proportion of publications reporting both the presence and the absence of signiﬁcant differences. The trend is conﬁrmed for particular natural science topics such as biology, energy and environment but not for papers retrieved with the keywords biodiversity, chemistry, computer, engineering, genetics, psychology and quantum (physics). A worsening ﬁle-drawer problem can be detected in various medical ﬁelds (infection, immunology, malaria, obesity, oncology and pharmacology), but not for papers indexed with strings such as AIDS/HIV, epidemiology, health and neurology. An increase in the selective publication of some results against some others is worrying because it can lead to enhanced bias in metaanalysis and hence to a distorted picture of the evidence for or against a certain hypothesis. Long-term monitoring of the ﬁle-drawer problem is needed to ensure a sustainable and reliable production of (peer-reviewed) scientiﬁc knowledge.},

Thirty-four of these first aiders were matched to respondents from a subject pool on the basis of sex, age, and socioeconomic status. In addition, the willingness of these respondents to offer help after a traffic accident was taken into account. Only people who indicated that they had witnessed an accident and had not helped were included in the control group. Multivariate analyses of variance and covariance indicated that proven first aiders deviated from the control group on several dimensions: Tbey described themselves as more internal, believed more in a just world, and emphasized more social responsibility and empathy.},

	abstract = {Columbia University offers two innovative undergraduate science-based bioethics courses for student majoring in biosciences and pre–health studies. The goals of these courses are to introduce future scientists and healthcare professionals to the ethical questions they will confront in their professional lives, thus enabling them to strategically address these bioethical dilemmas. These courses incorporate innovative pedagogical methods, case studies, and class discussions to stimulate the students to think creatively about bioethical issues emerging from new biotechnologies. At the end of each course, each student is required to submit a one-page strategy detailing how he or she would resolve a bioethical dilemma. Based on our experience in teaching these courses and on a qualitative analysis of the students’ reflections, we offer recommendations for creating an undergraduate science-based course in bioethics. General recommendations include: 1) integrating the science of emerging biotechnologies, their ethical ramifications, and contemporary bioethical theories into interactive class sessions; 2) structuring discussion-based classes to stimulate students to consider the impact of their moral intuitions when grappling with bioethical issues; and 3) using specific actual and futuristic case studies to highlight bioethical issues and to help develop creative problem-solving skills. Such a course sparks students’ interests in both science and ethics and helps them analyze bioethical challenges arising from emerging biotechnologies.},

We enrolled 164 cardiac patients in a study about the effects of gratitude and optimism. Two weeks post-enrollment, participants completed a four-item questionnaire regarding motivations for study enrollment. Altruistic motivation ranked highest, while intellectual, healthrelated, and financial motivations rated lower. Four subgroups of participants emerged, each with distinct characteristics and different priorities for participating. These findings may help front-line clinicians to understand which motivations for participation apply to their clients who enroll in non-treatment-based research projects.},

Convenience sampling facilitated by recruitment notices distributed through needle and syringe programmes (NSPs), and snowballing within peer networks. Setting. NSPs in six suburbs throughout the Melbourne metropolitan area. Participants. One hundred and fty-four current IDUs. The mean age was 28 years, 62\% were male, and 80\% nominated heroin as preferred drug. Measurements. Interviewer-administered survey including questions about socio-demographics, drug use and main reasons for participating in research. Findings. IDU research participation reasons were consistent with motivational themes such as economic gain (46\%), expression of citizenship (38\%), altruism (19\%), personal satisfaction (17\%), drug user activism (16\%) and seeking information or assistance (5\%). Most respondents (58\%) cited reasons where the primary bene ciaries of participation were other individuals or groups (citizenship, altruism, drug user activism) or both self and others. Conclusions. IDU motivations for research involvement appear to be multi-dimensional, rarely motivated by economic gain alone, and not necessarily de ned by direct bene ts or gains to themselves. These ndings are relevant to the question of IDU research payment ethics.},

	abstract = {Background: Research ethics boards (REBs) exist for good reason. By setting rules of ethical behaviour, REBs can help mitigate the risk of researchers causing harm to their research participants. However, the current method by which REBs promote ethical behaviour does little more than send researchers into the field with a set of rules to follow. While appropriate for most situations, rule-based approaches are often insufficient, and leave significant gaps where researchers are not provided institutional ethical direction.
Results: Through a discussion of a recent research project about drinking and driving in South Africa, this article demonstrates that if researchers are provided only with a set of rules for ethical behaviour, at least two kinds of problems can emerge: situations where action is required but there is no ethically good option (zungzwang ethical dilemmas) and situations where the ethical value of an action can only be assessed after the fact (contingent ethical dilemmas). These dilemmas highlight and help to articulate what we already intuit: that a solely rule-based approach to promoting ethical research is not always desirable, possible, effective, or consistent.
Conclusions: In this article, I argue that to better encourage ethical behaviour in research, there is a need to go beyond the rules and regulations articulated by ethics boards, and focus more specifically on creating and nurturing virtuous researchers.},

	abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly prominent in our daily lives, media coverage of the ethical considerations of these technologies has followed suit. Since previous research has shown that media coverage can drive public discourse about novel technologies, studying how the ethical issues of AI are portrayed in the media may lead to greater insight into the potential ramifications of this public discourse, particularly with regard to development and regulation of AI. This paper expands upon previous research by systematically analyzing and categorizing the media portrayal of the ethical issues of AI to better understand how media coverage of these issues may shape public debate about AI. Our results suggest that the media has a fairly realistic and practical focus in its coverage of the ethics of AI, but that the coverage is still shallow. A multifaceted approach to handling the social, ethical and policy issues of AI technology is needed, including increasing the accessibility of correct information to the public in the form of fact sheets and ethical value statements on trusted webpages (e.g., government agencies), collaboration and inclusion of ethics and AI experts in both research and public debate, and consistent government policies or regulatory frameworks for AI technology.},

In this article we explore bystander passivity in three settings based on existing literature: patient abuse in health care; bullying among schoolchildren; and oppressive treatment of students by teachers. Throughout the article we develop a theoretical approach that connects Obermann's unconcerned and guilty bystanders to theories of moral disengagement and moral distress respectively. Despite diﬀerences between the three settings, we show striking similarities between processes of disengagement, indicators of distress, and the constraints for intervention that bystanders identify. In relation to this, we discuss moral educational eﬀorts that aim to strengthen bystanders’ moral agency in health care and school settings. Many eﬀorts emphasize shared problem descriptions and collective responsibilities. As challenging as such eﬀorts may be, there can be much to gain in terms of welfare and justice.},

We also compute disaggregated estimates across several trial features including disease type, clinical phase, industry or academic sponsor, biomarker presence, lead indication status, and time. In several cases, our results differ signiﬁcantly in detail from widely cited statistics. For example, oncology has a 3.4\% success rate in our sample vs. 5.1\% in prior studies. However, after declining to 1.7\% in 2012, this rate has improved to 2.5\% and 8.3\% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition, trials that use biomarkers in patient-selection have higher overall success probabilities than trials without biomarkers.},

One of the most promising, if they can be successfully developed, is vaccines. While the technological development of such countermeasures is currently underway, a key social gap remains. Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors. To provide a starting place for this critical component of a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the 23-person Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID19 Vaccines was formed. One outcome of this group is a synthesis of the major challenges and opportunities associated with a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign and empirically-informed recommendations to advance public understanding of, access to, and acceptance of vaccines that protect against SARSCoV-2. While not inclusive of all possible steps than could or should be done to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination, the working group believes that the recommendations provided are essential for a successful vaccination program.},

The effort of the scientific community in searching a vaccine for COVID-19 may be hampered by a diffused vaccine hesitancy. Two waves of data collection on representative samples of the Italian population (during the “first” and “second” phase of the Italian Covid-19 mitigation strategy) were conducted to understand citizens’ perceptions and behaviors about preventive behaviors willingness to vaccine for COVID-19. Our study shows that willingness to COVID-19 vaccine is correlated to trust in research and in vaccines, which decreased between phase 1 and phase 2 of the Italian pandemic. According to the results of our study, the proportion of citizens that seem to be intentioned to get the Covid-19 vaccine is probably too small to effectively stop the spreading of the disease. This requires to foster a climate of respectful mutual trust between science and society, where scientific knowledge is not only preached but also cultivated and sustained thanks to the emphatic understanding of citizens worries, needs of reassurance and health expectations.},

In this article, I develop a few lines of criticism. First, I question whether Shiffrin’s framework of justiﬁed suspended contexts is appropriate for institutional settings. Second, I challenge the presumption that the knowledge-gathering function performed by police is necessarily compromised by insincere practices. Third, I criticize Shiffrin’s characterization of the university as involving a complete repudiation of enforced consensus, and I express doubts about the close connection between education and democratic legitimation that Shiffrin endorses. Finally, I raise a problem with the book’s overall argument: even if one agrees that speech freedoms are necessary for moral development, they also may be threatening to moral development. The upshot is that the protection of speech should be modulated in order to account for the potential conﬂicts between sincerity and other valuable ends, rather than being oriented above all to sincerity.},

Furthermore, not only are these claims analytically confused, they are epistemologically and politically dangerous. Sections 2-4 argue for these claims.

	abstract = {Background: The concept of vulnerability has held a central place in research ethics guidance since its introduction in the United States Belmont Report in 1979. It signals mindfulness for researchers and research ethics boards to the possibility that some participants may be at higher risk of harm or wrong. Despite its important intended purpose and widespread use, there is considerable disagreement in the scholarly literature about the meaning and delineation of vulnerability, stemming from a perceived lack of guidance within research ethics standards. The aim of this study was to assess the concept of vulnerability as it is employed in major national and international research ethics policies and guidelines.
Methods: We conducted an in-depth analysis of 11 (five national and six international) research ethics policies and guidelines, exploring their discussions of the definition, application, normative justification and implications of vulnerability.
Results: Few policies and guidelines explicitly defined vulnerability, instead relying on implicit assumptions and the delineation of vulnerable groups and sources of vulnerability. On the whole, we found considerable richness in the content on vulnerability across policies, but note that this relies heavily on the structure imposed on the data through our analysis.
Conclusions: Our results underscore a need for policymakers to revisit the guidance on vulnerability in research ethics, and we propose that a process of stakeholder engagement would well-support this effort.},
